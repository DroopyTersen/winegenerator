	"The acidity is refreshing but not overly tart, and the balance of structure to fruit is excellent.",
	"This is a simple but very, very tasty wine that delivers lots of pure fruit flavor without a lot of extraneous bells and whistles.",
	"Any influence from oak is virtually indiscernible, making this a very promising partner for a wide array of fish or chicken dishes.",
	"Bright and fresh as befits a crisp wine but still generously ripe, it hits just the right balance point between structure and softness to permit stand-alone sipping or pleasing paring with a wide range of moderately robust foods.",
	"It's fairly full-bodied, very round and very smooth in texture, with a medium amount of tannin that is far outweighed by the rich texture.",
	"Aromas and flavors are typically Mediterranean, suggesting ripe, almost baked dark fruits, earthiness and herbal nuances.",
	"Soft and rounded in texture, with very ripe, tender tannins in the classic mold, this is a lovely wine made with impressive skill and taste.",
	"This is a seriously delicious wine that succeeds by packing a lot of flavor and complexity onto a medium-bodied platform.",
	"The fruit is free from the excessively overt sweetness that unmasks many wines of this type.",
	"The texture is so pleasing that the wine is hard not to like."

	"The lead fruit notes are ~ and ~ with a healthy dose of ~ lending complexity and backbone, but still leaving space on the stage for nice little nuances of ~, ~, and ~.",
	"This wine shows very nice character, with notes of ~ and ripe ~, backed by accents of ~, ~ and ~.",
	"Notes of ~ and ~ are vivid and fresh, with crisp citric edge that freshens and lifts the rich, ripe fruit.",
	"Very nicely balanced and very broadly useful, this wine shows interesting notes suggesting both ~ and ~.",
	"There is a juiciness to the wine as well as a hint of ~ and ~.",
	"Notes of ~ lead the way on both the nose and palate, with just a little ~ as a sidelight.",
	"This wine is light and admirably delicate, with real character from fresh, bright notes of ~ and with nice little sidelights of ~ and ~.",
	"A dense color leads to forward ripe ~ aromas, with traces of ~.",

	 "The merits of this wine are quite clear: expressive but nuanced aromas and flavors of ~ and ~ with lovely, subtle accents of ~ and ~.",
	 "This wine is soft and succulent in feel and flavor, with notes of ~ and ~ remaining in the forefront thanks to mercifully subtle use of oak."
